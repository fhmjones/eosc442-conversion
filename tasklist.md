# EOSC442 update tasks

We were going to use Issues to manage the task list. That would be great. Once issues are established, this file can be dropped.

## F.J. to ask 

See Issue # 1.  

## Tasks 

1) Convert the four matlab training and data analysis labs to Python. Needs solutions – still need to find them. Make the repos “private” once solns are included. 
2) Do L1a last, L1b first, then L2, etc. 
3) Sequence: (We do not yet know how these will be completed. Options include: (a) using a cloud JNB server, (b) having students load Python and JNB to their own laptops, or (c) running these on computers in the EOAS computing lab.)
  1) Make them work in Python using whatever means you prefer.
  2) Make them into Jupyter Notebooks.  
4) Build Lab 1a - introducing Python. The OCESE project now has resources that can be adapted. 
5) Guidelines for instructing (mostly TAs), including editing and managing Jupyter Notebooks, delivering assignments, teaching in labs, collecting student work, grading and returning grades & feedback to students. 

## Potential challenges and recommended practices
1) What are best practices for converting MatLab “thinking” into Python? 
  1) See for example https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/ 
  2) We’ll get “expert opinion” when it seems appropriate
2) “Keep it simple” – as few libraries as possible. 
3) What plotting library? EOSC 211 uses ______________?? DSCI 100 uses ____________?? Maybe check all the other prereques. 
4) Working with dates may be tricky. 

## Other notes – not priorities.

1) MAYBE LATER - New climate-related data sources (OCESE project personnel not directly involved).
   1) Work is to be completed by a hired student, probably summer 2022. 
   2) Unlikely to significantly affect course activities since existing assignments probably can be quickly re-oriented towards new data sources. 
   3) Also, many of these data sets will likely be used as project materials rather than in class-wide assignments or labs.
